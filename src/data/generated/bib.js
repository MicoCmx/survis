        "abstract": "Human-Centric Software Engineering (HCSE) refers to the software engineering (SE) processes that put human needs and requirements as core practice throughout the software development life cycle. A large majority of software projects fail to cater to human needs and consequently run into budget, delivery, and usability issues. To support human-centric software engineering practices, it is important for universities to train their students on how to consider human needs. But what topics from HCSE should be provided in the undergraduate curriculum? This is still an open question. Curriculum guidelines for software engineering are available, however do not represent update to date considerations for how human-factors are included. In addition, curriculum approaches are not explored. To address this issue, this paper presents a scoping review to identify the topics and curriculum approaches suitable for teaching HCSE to undergraduate software engineering students. The scoping review was conducted according to the protocol by PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). Through PRISMA-ScR, a total of 36 conference or journal papers were identified as viable for analysis, with 5 common themes found that describe topics and curriculum approaches relevant for teaching software engineering. Using the outcomes of the scoping review, this paper also analyses the Australian Software Engineering curriculum to understand the extent at which human centred software engineering topics are scaffolded into course structures. This paper concludes by suggesting topic scaffolding for the undergraduate curriculum that aligns with the software engineering process. Overall, by providing a focus on HCSE topics and curriculum approaches, the education and awareness of HCSE among current and future software engineers can increase, leading to long-term impact on the success of software projects for all stakeholders.CCS Concepts\u2022 Software and its engineering \u2192 Software creation and management; Designing software;",

        "abstract": "In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), generative AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs) in particular, have become increasingly significant in various sectors. LLMs such as GPT expand their applications, from content creation to advanced code completion. They offer unmatched opportunities but pose unique challenges to the software engineering domain. This paper discusses the necessity and urgency for software engineering education to adapt and evolve to prepare software engineers for the emerging LLM environment. While existing literature and social media have investigated AI's integration into various educational spheres, there is a conspicuous gap in examining the specifics of LLMs' implications for software engineering education. We explore the goals of software engineering education, and changes to software engineering, software engineering education, course pedagogy, and ethics. We argue that a holistic approach is needed, combining technical skills, ethical awareness, and adaptable learning strategies. This paper seeks to contribute to the ongoing conversation about the future of software engineering education, emphasizing the importance of adapting and evolving to remain in sync with rapid advancements in AI and LLMs. It is hoped that this exploration will provide valuable insights for educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers in software engineering.",

One of the service-sectors that have benefited the most has been Education. In this sector, the implementation of current and emerging technologies combined with innovative pedagogical procedures and best practices is known as Education 4.0, which, in this paper, is described and mapped according to the well-known periods of the four industrial revolutions and related to higher education. Likewise, four core components of Education 4.0 to be used as a reference for the design of new projects in educational innovation are proposed (i) Competencies, (ii) Learning Methods, (iii) Information and Communication Technologies, and (iv) Infrastructure. Finally, three case studies applied to Engineering Education illustrate how the proposed components are considered in educational programs' designs.",

        "abstract": "The developments in conversational AI raised urgent questions about the future direction of many aspects of society, including computing education. The first reactions to the fast-paced evolution of conversational agents were varied: Some announced \u201cthe end of programming,\u201d while others considered this \u201cpremature obituary of programming.\u201d Some adopted a defensive approach to detecting the use of conversational AI and avoiding an increase in plagiarism, while others questioned, \u201cSo what if ChatGPT wrote it?\u201d Nevertheless, questions arise about whether computing education in its current form will still be relevant and fit for purpose in the era of conversational AI. Recognizing these diverse reactions to the advent of conversational AI, this paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse by exploring the current state through three perspectives in a dedicated literature review: adoption of conversational AI in (1) software engineering education specifically and (2) computing education in general, and (3) a comparison with software engineering practice. Our results show a gap between software engineering practice and higher education in the pace of adoption and the areas of use and generally identify preliminary research on student experience, teaching, and learning tools for software engineering.",

        "abstract": "In the present digital era, being skilled and updated on modern software development practices has become of crucial importance for software engineering graduates. Moreover, the freelancing industry has grown immensely in recent years, and individuals, more than ever before, are fascinated by the opportunities it offers and have greater assurance that it can be a successful and satisfying alternative to regular employment. Unlike others, in the case of software, industry is leading the education. This makes Software Engineering Education (SEE) additionally responsible for minimizing the gap between the skills of the graduating students and the skills needed by the employers out there. There is not any previous work available in this that focuses on the skills required to cope with the freelancing industry by graduate students and recommendations for improvements to Pakistan higher education curriculum that help produce graduates who are capable enough to get themselves employed in freelancing platforms. This study aims to dissect the software industry needs and trends related to the freelancing industry and to uncover suggestions for training in this dynamic field. The data was extracted through different freelancing platforms using the Scrapy framework of Python, and then LDA analysis was performed on the scraped data using Python to find the most trending topics in the SE field and better analyze the situation. Using LDA analysis, the dataset extracted at two distinct time periods is investigated to describe how the software industry changes from time to time. For validity, the updated data was scraped on runtime from freelancing websites. The results of the analysis are shown in different formats, and empirical findings are discussed with reference to two different time periods and in relation to previous studies.",

        "abstract": "Software engineering educators are continually challenged by rapidly evolving concepts, technologies, and industry demands. Due to the omnipresence of software in a digitalized society, higher education institutions (HEIs) have to educate the students such that they learn how to learn, and that they are equipped with a profound basic knowledge and with latest knowledge about modern software and system development. Since industry demands change constantly, HEIs are challenged in meeting such current and future demands in a timely manner. This paper analyzes the current state of practice in software engineering education. Specifically, we want to compare contemporary education with industrial practice to understand if frameworks, methods and practices for software and system development taught at HEIs reflect industrial practice. For this, we conducted an online survey and collected information about 67 software engineering courses. Our findings show that development approaches taught at HEIs quite closely reflect industrial practice. We also found that the choice of what process to teach is sometimes driven by the wish to make a course successful. Especially when this happens for project courses, it could be beneficial to put more emphasis on building learning sequences with other courses.",

        "abstract": "Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the gap between software engineering education and the needs and practices of the software industry. Many of them aim to promote a more active learning attitude in students and provide them with more realistic experiences, thus recreating industry software development environments and collaborative development and, in some cases, with the involvement of companies mainly acting as potential customers. Since many degree courses typically offer separate subjects to teach requirements engineering, analysis and design, coding, or validation, the integration of all these phases normally necessitates experience in a project context and is usually carried out in a final year project. The approach described in this article benefits from the close involvement of a software house company which goes beyond the common involvement of a potential customer. Students are integrated into distributed teams comprising students, teachers and IT professionals. Teams follow the agile Scrum methodology and use the OutSystems low-code development platform providing students with the experience of an almost real scenario. The results show that this approach complements the knowledge and practice acquired in course subjects, develops the students\u2019 technical and non-technical skills, such as commitment, teamwork, and communication, and initiates them in the methodologies and development strategies used in these companies. The feedback from the teachers involved, software companies and students was very positive.",

        "abstract": "The increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering education presents both opportunities and challenges. While LLMs offer benefits such as enhanced learning experiences, automated assessments, and personalized tutoring, their integration also raises concerns about academic integrity, student over-reliance, and ethical considerations. In this study, we conducted a preliminary literature review to identify motivators and demotivators for using LLMs in software engineering education. We applied a thematic mapping process to categorize and structure these factors (motivators and demotivators), offering a comprehensive view of their impact. In total, we identified 25 motivators and 30 demotivators, which are further organized into four high-level themes. This mapping provides a structured framework for understanding the factors that influence the integration of LLMs in software engineering education, both positively and negatively. As part of a larger research project, this study serves as a feasibility assessment, laying the groundwork for future systematic literature review and empirical studies. Ultimately, this project aims to develop a framework to assist Finnish higher education institutions in effectively integrating LLMs into software engineering education while addressing potential risks and challenges.",
